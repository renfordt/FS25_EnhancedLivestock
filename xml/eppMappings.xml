        EPP Butcher Integration Configuration

        This file configures how Enhanced Livestock animals are processed
        at ExtendedProductionPoint (EPP) butchers.

        When an EL animal is delivered to a butcher, the integration:
        1. Calculates an "animal equivalent" based on weight, quality, and health
        2. Stores this as the INTERMEDIATE fill type (e.g., BEEF, PIGS)
        3. The butcher's production chain then converts this to final meat

        This allows EL's variable animal values to integrate naturally with
        EPP's production system while remaining compatible with vanilla FS25.

    <!--
        Meat yield percentages (0.0 - 1.0) representing carcass yield

        NOTE: These are currently kept for reference/backward compatibility
        but are not used in the animal equivalent calculation. The animal
        equivalent is based on weight vs. reference weight, not meat yield.
    -->
    <yields>
        <yield animalType="COW" percentage="0.60"/>      <!-- 60% carcass yield for cattle -->
        <yield animalType="PIG" percentage="0.72"/>      <!-- 72% carcass yield for pigs -->
        <yield animalType="SHEEP" percentage="0.50"/>    <!-- 50% carcass yield for sheep -->
        <yield animalType="CHICKEN" percentage="0.65"/> <!-- 65% carcass yield for chickens -->
        <yield animalType="HORSE" percentage="0.55"/>    <!-- 55% carcass yield for horses -->
    </yields>

    <!--
        Reference weights for "standard" animals (in kg)

        These represent the weight of a typical adult animal of average quality.
        The animal equivalent is calculated as:
            (actual_weight / reference_weight) * quality_factor * health_factor

        For example, a 600kg cow with quality 1.0 and 100% health:
            (600 / 500) * 1.0 * 1.0 = 1.2 animal equivalents

        This means the butcher will receive 1.2x the normal amount of the
        intermediate fill type (BEEF), which then produces 1.2x the normal meat.
    -->
    <referenceWeights>
        <weight animalType="COW" kg="500"/>      <!-- 500 kg standard cow -->
        <weight animalType="PIG" kg="110"/>      <!-- 110 kg standard pig -->
        <weight animalType="SHEEP" kg="45"/>     <!-- 45 kg standard sheep -->
        <weight animalType="CHICKEN" kg="2.5"/>  <!-- 2.5 kg standard chicken -->
        <weight animalType="HORSE" kg="500"/>    <!-- 500 kg standard horse -->
    </referenceWeights>

    <!--
        Animal type to INTERMEDIATE fill type name mapping (fallback)

        These are the INPUT fill types that EPP uses before the production
        chain converts them to final meat. For example:
        - BEEF (input) -> Production -> MEAT (output)
        - PIGS (input) -> Production -> JAMBON (output)

        The integration will first try to use EPP's animalSubTypeToFillType
        or animalTypeToFillType mappings. These are only used as fallbacks
        if the butcher doesn't provide its own mappings.

        Common intermediate fill types used by butcher mods:
        - The Butcher mod: BEEF, PIGS, SHEEPGOAT, POULTRY
        - Other mods may use different names
