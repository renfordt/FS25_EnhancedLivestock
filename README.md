## ✨ Features

### 🐂 Male Animals
Transform your breeding program with the addition of male animals:
- **Higher market value** compared to females
- **Essential for reproduction** - realistic breeding requirements
- Uses vanilla models (no custom 3D models required)
- **Highland Cattle bull** now available as a male variant

### 👀 Visual Animals
Enhanced animal visualization system:
- **Increased capacity** from 25 (vanilla) up to **200 visual animals** per husbandry
- **Adjustable limit** via in-game slider for performance optimization

### 🏷️ Individual Animals
Every animal is truly unique with comprehensive individual tracking:
- **100% individual animals** - archaic cluster system completely removed
- **Unique identifiers** based on the UK's cattle identification system
- **Birthday and country of origin** for each animal
- **Customizable names** for your livestock
- **Nose rings** on supported animals

### 🤰 Enhanced Pregnancy System
Realistic and dynamic reproduction mechanics:
- **Species-specific litter sizes** (e.g., cows can have 0-3 calves)
- **Conception at impregnation** - offspring created when mother is impregnated, not at birth
- **Pregnancy tracking** - view expected offspring count and due dates
- **Individual gestation periods** - reproduction duration varies by animal, not by species

### 🧬 Genetics System
Deep genetic simulation affecting every aspect of animal performance:
- **Five genetic traits**:
    - 💚 **Health** - resistance to disease and injury
    - 👶 **Fertility** - reproduction success rates
    - ⚡ **Metabolism** - food consumption and weight regulation
    - 📈 **Productivity** - milk, wool, and egg production
    - 🥩 **Meat Quality** - value at slaughter
- **Inheritance mechanics** - offspring inherit traits from parents
- **Economic impact** - genetics directly affect sale value and profitability

### ⚖️ Weight System
Dynamic weight management with real consequences:
- **Individual weight tracking** for every animal
- **Daily weight fluctuations** based on food and water consumption
- **Ideal weight targets** influenced by metabolism genetics
- **Health consequences** - unhealthy weight affects health and can lead to death
- **Vulnerable young animals** - juveniles especially susceptible to weight-related health issues
- **Sale value impact** - weight directly affects market price

### 🖥️ Enhanced UI
Comprehensive information at your fingertips:
- **Family tree viewer** - track lineage and breeding lines
- **Detailed animal screens** - extensive stats and information
- **Enhanced info boxes** - quick access to vital animal data
- Clean, intuitive interface design

### 📊 Enhanced Production
Realistic production cycles based on biological factors:
- **🥛 Cow milk production**:
    - Only produce milk when lactating
    - Yield rises and falls based on lactation curve
    - Production tied to pregnancy cycle
- **🧶 Sheep wool production**:
    - Seasonal wool growth
    - Only produce wool during warm months
- **Production affected by genetics and health**

### ⏳ Death and Aging
Natural lifecycle with meaningful consequences:
- **No age limits** - animals can live beyond 5 years
- **Species-specific lifespans** - each animal type has realistic expected lifespan
- **Progressive mortality** - increasing death chance with age, but can live past expectancy
- **Multiple death causes**:
    - 👴 Old age
    - 💔 Poor health
    - ⚠️ Random accidents
    - 🤰 Pregnancy complications

### 🏪 Enhanced Animal Dealer
Completely reimagined purchasing experience:
- **Global farm network** - hundreds of unique farms across supported countries
- **Farm specialization** - each farm produces up to 3 animal types
- **Daily deliveries** - farms send animals to dealer each day
- **Time-limited availability** - animals eventually disappear if not purchased
- **Dynamic inventory** - continuous rotation with new animals
- **Local and imported stock** - mostly local animals with occasional imports
- **Unique genetics** - every animal has individual traits affecting price
- **Pregnant animals available** - chance to purchase pregnant stock
- **Quality-based pricing** - farm quality affects animal traits and cost

### 🦠 Disease System
Comprehensive health management with realistic disease mechanics:
- **Multiple disease types** - Various conditions affecting different animal species
- **Transmission mechanics** - Diseases can spread between animals in the same husbandry
- **Treatment options** - Pay for veterinary care to cure sick animals
- **Immunity periods** - Animals gain temporary immunity after recovery
- **Production impact** - Diseases affect milk, wool, and other outputs
- **Fatality risk** - Untreated conditions can be fatal over time

### 🤖 AI Herdsman
Automated animal management system:
- **Automated buying** - Purchase animals matching your criteria
- **Automated selling** - Sell animals based on configurable filters
- **Castration management** - Automatic castration based on rules
- **Naming service** - Auto-naming for new animals
- **Insemination service** - Automated breeding management
- **Monthly wage system** - Pay wages based on services and animal count
- **Configurable filters** - Set criteria for age, genetics, gender, health, and more

### 💉 Artificial Insemination
Advanced breeding with pedigree genetics:
- **Dewar storage** - Store and manage pedigree semen
- **Hand tool system** - Manual insemination with specialized equipment
- **Genetic selection** - Choose specific genetics for offspring
- **Shop integration** - Purchase semen from various sources

### 📝 Message Log
Event tracking for your husbandries:
- **Birth notifications** - Track new arrivals
- **Death records** - Log animal deaths with causes
- **Transaction history** - Record purchases and sales
- **Health events** - Disease outbreaks and recoveries
- **AI Herdsman actions** - Log automated management decisions

### 🥩 Butcher Integration
Seamless integration with EPP Butcher mod:
- **Direct slaughter** - send animals to butcher directly from the animal screen
- **Automatic processing** - works with installed EPP Butcher placeables
