# Horses

Horses are unique livestock focused on training and riding rather than production. They offer the highest individual animal value.

## Breeds

Enhanced Livestock includes eight horse color variants, all sharing similar characteristics:

### Available Colors

| Breed/Color | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Gray | Light gray coat |
| Pinto | Spotted pattern |
| Palomino | Golden coat with light mane |
| Chestnut | Reddish-brown coat |
| Bay | Brown body with black points |
| Black | Solid black coat |
| Seal Brown | Dark brown, nearly black |
| Dun | Tan/gold with primitive markings |

### Weight Characteristics

| Property | Female (Mare) | Male (Stallion) |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Target Weight | 500 kg | 575 kg |
| Max Weight | 900 kg | 1,000 kg |
| Birth Weight | 45 kg | 48 kg |

## Reproduction

### Fertility
Horses reach breeding maturity at approximately 24 months.

### Pregnancy
- **Gestation period:** Approximately 11 months
- **Litter size:** 1 foal (twins are rare)
- **Minimum health for breeding:** 75%

!!! note "Long Investment"
    Horses have the longest gestation period and slowest maturation of all livestock. They are a long-term investment.

## Production

Unlike other livestock, horses don't produce marketable products directly:

| Output | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Manure | Only production output |
| Value | Comes from training and sale |

### Value Development
Horse value increases through:

- Age and maturation
- Training (riding)
- Health maintenance
- Genetics

## Input Requirements

Horses require quality care:

| Input | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Food | High-quality hay/feed |
| Water | Fresh water always |
| Space | Large pasture area |
| Exercise | Regular riding/training |

## Training System

Horses gain value through training:

1. **Ride regularly** - Increases training level
2. **Maintain health** - Healthy horses train better
3. **Consistent care** - Regular attention improves performance
4. **Time investment** - Training takes months to years

## Horse Economics

### Purchase Considerations

| Age | Value | Training Potential |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| Foal | Low | Maximum potential |
| Young | Medium | High potential |
| Trained Adult | High | Immediate value |
| Older | Variable | Limited remaining time |

### Sale Strategy

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Breed and sell young | Quick turnover, lower profit per horse |
| Train and sell | Higher profit, longer investment |
| Breeding stock | Premium prices for quality genetics |

## Management Tips

!!! tip "Successful Horse Farming"
    - **Quality over quantity** - Horses need individual attention
    - **Training consistency** - Regular riding sessions
    - **Health priority** - Veterinary care is essential
    - **Breeding selection** - Choose genetics carefully
    - **Patience** - Horse farming is a long-term endeavor

## Herdsman Considerations

The AI Herdsman charges the highest rate for horses ($25/month per animal) due to their specialized care requirements.

## Visual Features

- Ear tags (though less prominent than cattle)
- Color-specific models
- Age progression (foal to adult)
- Riding capability indicators
