# Infectious Bronchitis

Infectious Bronchitis is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease causing sneezing, gasping, and nasal discharge. While mortality is low (5%), it causes permanent reproductive tract damage leading to wrinkled, poor-quality eggs **even after recovery**. Winter seasonality (1.5x) makes it a cold-weather threat.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens only |
| Transmission Rate | 15% per month (very high, tied with Newcastle) |
| Immunity Period | 12 months |
| Recovery Time | 2 months (natural) |
| Sale Value Impact | 40% reduction (0.6 multiplier) |
| Seasonal Pattern | **Winter 1.5x**, Summer 0.5x |

!!! warning "Permanent Reproductive Damage"
    Even after recovery, birds may have permanently reduced egg quality and production due to oviduct damage. This makes Infectious Bronchitis economically significant despite low mortality.

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| All ages | 0.2% per month |

**Health Genetics**: 1.75: 0.05% | 1.0: 0.2% | 0.25: 0.35%
**Seasonal (Critical)**: Spring 1.0x | Summer 0.5x | Autumn 1.0x | **Winter 1.5x**
**Overcrowding**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

**Example - Winter outbreak**: Average health, winter, overcrowded:
- Base: 0.2% × 1.0 health × 1.5 winter × 2.0 overcrowding = **0.6% monthly chance**

### Transmission

**15% transmission** (tied for highest with Newcastle) - spreads extremely rapidly:
- Airborne via respiratory droplets
- Survives in environment for weeks
- Spreads through entire flock within days of introduction

**Winter peak**: Cold weather + increased indoor crowding = perfect conditions

**Herd immunity**: >70% immune = 90% reduction

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Egg Production | 30% (70% reduction) |

!!! danger "Long-Term Production Impact"
    The 70% egg reduction continues even AFTER recovery in many birds due to permanent oviduct damage. Birds may never return to full production.

### Fatality

| Time | Fatality Rate |
|------|---------------|
| Any | 5% (constant low rate) |

!!! note "Low Mortality, High Economic Impact"
    While only 5% die, the permanent reproductive damage affects profitability far more than death loss.

## Disease Progression

1. **Active (Untreated)**: Sneezing, gasping, nasal discharge, watery eyes, 70% egg loss, 5% death risk
2. **Being Treated**: $30 for 1 month, reduces symptoms and transmission
3. **Immune (Recovered)**: Immunity granted, but **permanent egg quality reduction** in many birds

**Natural Recovery**: After 2 months, 75% chance/month. Low death risk makes natural recovery viable, but prolongs production loss and permanent damage risk.

**Permanent Damage**: Oviduct scarring causes:
- Misshapen eggs
- Thin shells
- Reduced egg size
- Lower total production
- Permanent reduction in laying capability

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $30 (very affordable) |
| Duration | 1 month |
| Immunity | 12 months |

!!! tip "Treat to Minimize Permanent Damage"
    $30 treatment won't reverse oviduct damage, but faster recovery may reduce scarring. Main benefit is stopping 15% transmission and restoring production sooner.

## Prevention

**Vaccination (Critical)**
- **Regular vaccination** - Annual boosters
- **Multi-strain vaccines** - Many IB strains exist
- **Chick vaccination** - Protectbefore exposure
- **Entire flock coverage**

**Ventilation (Winter Focus)**
- **Good air exchange** - Critical in winter when birds crowded indoors
- **Avoid drafts** - Cold stress increases susceptibility
- **Humidity control** - Dry air reduces viral survival
- **Balance warmth and ventilation**

**Biosecurity**
- **All-in/all-out** - Prevents continuous infection cycles
- **Quarantine new birds** - 30 days minimum
- **Clean between flocks** - Virus survives weeks in environment
- **Limit visitors in winter** - Peak transmission season

**Environmental**
- **Avoid overcrowding** - Especially critical in winter
- **Extra space in winter** - Birds spend more time indoors
- **Stress reduction** - Stress increases susceptibility

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Unvaccinated flock | Very high - 15% transmission spreads rapidly |
| **Winter season** | **1.5x risk** |
| Poor ventilation | Very high - especially in winter |
| Overcrowding | Doubles risk |
| Cold stress | High |
| Mixed-age flocks | High |

## Economic Impact

**Layer with Infectious Bronchitis (treated):**
- Treatment: $30
- Egg loss: 1 month at 70% = ~$10-15 lost
- Death risk: 5%
- **Permanent damage**: May never return to 100% production
- Expected cost: $30 + $12 eggs + potential permanent reduction

**Layer with Infectious Bronchitis (natural recovery, 3 months):**
- Treatment: $0
- Egg loss: 3 months at 70% = ~$30-45 lost
- Death risk: 5%
- **Permanent damage**: Higher risk with longer infection
- Expected cost: $0 treatment + $37.50 eggs + permanent reduction

**Flock of 100 layers, winter outbreak, 20 infected:**
- Treatment (all 20): 20 × $30 = $600
- Egg loss during treatment: 20 × 1 month × $15 = $300
- Transmission prevented
- **Total: ~$900**

**vs. Untreated:**
- Transmission: 15% × 20/100 = 3% per bird per month
- Month 2: 30 more infected
- Month 3: 50 total infected
- Egg losses: 50 birds × 3 months avg × $15 = $2,250
- Permanent damage: 50 birds with reduced production for life
- **Total: $2,250+ plus permanent flock damage**

**Prevention (vaccination):**
- Cost: 100 birds × $0.75/year = $75
- Prevents most cases
- **$75 prevention vs $900+ outbreak**

### Long-Term Impact

The real cost is **permanent reproductive damage**:
- Bird that lays 250 eggs/year normally
- After IB: may lay only 175 eggs/year
- Permanent reduction: 75 eggs/year × $0.15/egg = **$11.25/year forever**
- If 20 birds permanently damaged: 20 × $11.25 = **$225/year permanent loss**

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Infectious Bronchitis Prevention and Control Protocol"
    **1. Vaccination (Essential)**
       - Annual vaccination for all birds
       - Multi-strain vaccines (IB has many strains)
       - Chicks vaccinated before 3 weeks old
       - Booster as recommended

    **2. Winter Vigilance (Peak Season)**
       - 1.5x risk in winter (Dec-Feb)
       - Monitor closely during cold months
       - Balance ventilation with warmth
       - Don't overcrowd in winter housing
       - Extra biosecurity in peak season

    **3. Ventilation Management**
       - Good air exchange year-round
       - Critical in winter when birds indoors more
       - Avoid cold drafts (stress)
       - Control humidity
       - Fresh air reduces viral load

    **4. Early Detection**
       - Watch for: sneezing, gasping, watery eyes, nasal discharge
       - Sudden egg production drop
       - Respiratory sounds in flock
       - Detect early to minimize permanent damage

    **5. Immediate Treatment**
       - $30 is very affordable
       - Faster recovery = less oviduct damage
       - Reduces transmission (15% rate)
       - Prevents flock-wide outbreak

    **6. Isolation**
       - Separate sick birds if possible
       - 15% transmission spreads rapidly
       - Reduce contact with healthy birds
       - Treat entire affected group

    **7. Accept Permanent Damage**
       - Some birds never return to full production
       - Oviduct scarring is permanent
       - May need to cull poor producers after recovery
       - Factor into long-term flock management

    **8. Culling Decisions**
       - After recovery, assess egg production
       - Birds with severe permanent damage
       - May be more economical to cull and replace
       - vs. keeping poor producers for years

    **9. Biosecurity**
       - All-in/all-out management
       - Clean thoroughly between flocks
       - Quarantine new birds 30 days
       - Limit visitor access in winter

    **10. Long-Term Prevention**
       - Maintain vaccination program
       - Good ventilation infrastructure
       - Avoid overcrowding
       - Plan for winter housing needs
       - Genetic selection for respiratory health
