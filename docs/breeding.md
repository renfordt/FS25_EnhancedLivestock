# Breeding

Enhanced Livestock introduces realistic breeding mechanics that require proper planning and animal management.

## Requirements

### Male Animals Required
Unlike vanilla Farming Simulator, reproduction requires both male and female animals:

- **Bulls** for cattle
- **Boars** for pigs
- **Rams** for sheep and goats
- **Stallions** for horses
- **Roosters** for chickens

!!! note "Male Value"
    Male animals have higher market value compared to females due to their essential role in breeding.

### Health Requirements
Animals must meet minimum health requirements to breed successfully:

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| Minimum Health | 75% |
| Healthy Weight | Required |
| No Critical Diseases | Required |

## Pregnancy System

### Conception
When a female animal becomes pregnant:

1. Offspring are created at conception (not at birth)
2. Genetics are determined from both parents
3. Litter size is calculated based on species

### Species-Specific Litter Sizes

| Animal | Litter Size |
|--------|-------------|
| Cattle | 1-3 calves |
| Pigs | 6-14 piglets |
| Sheep | 1-3 lambs |
| Goats | 1-3 kids |
| Horses | 1 foal |
| Chickens | Variable |

### Gestation Periods
Each pregnancy has an individual duration based on:

- Species baseline
- Individual animal variation
- Health conditions

| Animal | Average Gestation |
|--------|-------------------|
| Cattle | 10 months |
| Pigs | 4 months |
| Sheep | 5 months |
| Goats | 5 months |
| Horses | 11 months |
| Chickens | 21 days |

## Pregnancy Tracking

You can monitor pregnancies through the animal details screen:

- **Pregnancy status** - Whether the animal is pregnant
- **Expected offspring** - Number of babies expected
- **Due date** - When birth will occur

## Fertility by Age

Animals have age-dependent fertility curves:

### Cattle Example
```
Age 0-12 months:  Not fertile
Age 12-24 months: Coming into fertility
Age 24-60 months: Peak fertility
Age 60-84 months: Declining fertility
Age 84+ months:   Very low fertility
```

## Artificial Insemination

Enhanced Livestock supports artificial insemination:

### Dewar System
- **Dewar objects** store pedigree semen
- **Hand tools** allow manual insemination
- Purchase semen from the animal dealer

### Benefits
- Access to genetics without keeping males
- Precise breeding control
- Premium genetic lines available

## Breeding Tips

!!! tip "Successful Breeding Program"
    1. **Maintain male-to-female ratios** - Ensure adequate males for your herd size
    2. **Select for desired traits** - Choose breeding pairs with complementary genetics
    3. **Monitor health** - Keep animals healthy to maximize fertility
    4. **Track lineage** - Avoid inbreeding by monitoring family trees
    5. **Age management** - Breed animals during their peak fertility years

## Complications

Pregnancy can have complications:

- **Failed pregnancies** - Low health can cause pregnancy loss
- **Difficult births** - Some births may result in animal loss
- **Weak offspring** - Poor conditions affect offspring health

Maintain good animal welfare to minimize complications.
