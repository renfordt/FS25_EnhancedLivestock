# Mastitis

Mastitis is an infection of the udder that affects lactating dairy animals, causing significant production losses.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Cattle, Sheep |
| Transmission Rate | 5% |
| Immunity Period | 12 months |
| Recovery Time | 3 months |
| Sale Value Impact | 15% reduction |

## Prerequisites

Mastitis only affects animals that are currently lactating. Non-lactating animals cannot contract this disease.

| Condition | Required |
|-----------|----------|
| Lactating | Yes |

## Probability

The probability of contracting mastitis increases with age:

| Age | Probability |
|-----|-------------|
| 0-12 months | 0% (not lactating) |
| 12+ months | 0.5% base chance |

## Symptoms and Effects

### Production Impact

Mastitis severely impacts milk production:

| Output | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Milk | 0% (complete stop) |
| Pallet production | 0% (complete stop) |

!!! warning "Complete Production Loss"
    Animals with mastitis produce no milk until treated and recovered.

### Fatality

Mastitis is not fatal:

| Time | Fatality Rate |
|------|---------------|
| Any | 0% |

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $200 |
| Duration | 1 month |

### Treatment Process

1. Select the infected animal
2. Choose the treatment option
3. Pay the treatment cost
4. Wait for the treatment duration
5. Animal recovers and gains immunity

## Prevention

### Best Practices

- **Milking hygiene** - Maintain clean milking conditions
- **Dry period management** - Proper dry-off procedures
- **Nutrition** - Well-fed animals have better immune response
- **Genetics** - High health genetics reduce susceptibility

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Risk Level |
|--------|------------|
| Poor hygiene | High |
| Stress | Medium |
| Poor nutrition | Medium |
| Low health genetics | Medium |

## Economic Impact

### Direct Costs

| Cost Type | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Treatment | $200 per case |
| Lost milk production | Variable (duration dependent) |

### Indirect Costs

- Reduced herd productivity
- Potential spread to other lactating animals
- Management time

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Managing Mastitis"
    1. **Monitor lactating animals** - Check regularly for signs
    2. **Treat promptly** - Early treatment reduces losses
    3. **Improve conditions** - Better hygiene reduces occurrence
    4. **Selective breeding** - Breed for high health genetics
    5. **Cull chronic cases** - Some animals are more susceptible
