# CVM (Complex Vertebral Malformation)

CVM is a genetic disease in cattle that causes severe developmental defects, typically resulting in death shortly after birth.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Cattle |
| Type | Genetic (Recessive) |
| Transmission | None (inherited only) |
| Sale Value Impact | 25% reduction |

## Genetic Nature

CVM is a recessive genetic condition:

| Inheritance | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Both parents carriers | 25% chance of affected offspring |
| One parent carrier | 50% chance of carrier offspring |
| Neither parent carrier | No affected offspring |

!!! info "Carrier Status"
    Animals can be carriers of CVM without showing symptoms. Carriers pass the gene to offspring.

### Carrier Detection

Carriers can be identified through:

- Pedigree analysis
- Affected offspring
- Sale records (5% chance carriers appear at dealer)

## Fatality

CVM is almost always fatal shortly after birth:

| Time | Fatality Rate |
|------|---------------|
| Birth | 95% |
| 1 month | 100% |

## Carrier Benefits

Interestingly, carriers of CVM show enhanced milk production:

| Output | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Milk | 150% (50% increase) |

!!! note "Carrier Advantage"
    CVM carriers produce significantly more milk, which historically led to their prevalence in dairy herds before genetic testing was available.

## Treatment

There is no treatment for CVM. Affected animals will not survive.

| Treatment | Available |
|-----------|-----------|
| Medicine | No |
| Surgery | No |

## Prevention

### Breeding Management

| Strategy | Effectiveness |
|----------|--------------|
| Test breeding stock | High |
| Avoid carrier x carrier | Eliminates affected offspring |
| Cull carriers | Eliminates gene from herd |
| Track pedigrees | Identifies at-risk pairings |

### Decision Considerations

| Keep Carriers? | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|------|------|
| Yes | Higher milk production | Risk of affected offspring |
| No | No disease risk | Lower milk production |

## Economic Impact

### Costs

| Impact | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Affected calf loss | 100% loss of animal |
| Reduced sale value | 25% reduction if symptomatic |

### Benefits (Carriers)

| Benefit | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Milk production | +50% |

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Managing CVM"
    1. **Know your genetics** - Track carrier status in your records
    2. **Strategic breeding** - Never breed carrier to carrier
    3. **Weigh the trade-offs** - Carriers produce more milk but carry risk
    4. **Monitor births** - Identify affected calves early
    5. **Long-term planning** - Decide whether to eliminate the gene from your herd
