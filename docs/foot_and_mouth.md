# Foot and Mouth Disease

Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals, causing significant economic losses.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Cattle, Sheep, Pigs |
| Transmission Rate | 10% |
| Immunity Period | 24 months |
| Recovery Time | With treatment |
| Sale Value Impact | 50% reduction |

## Probability

FMD probability increases with age:

| Age | Base Probability |
|-----|-----------------|
| 0-6 months | 0% increasing to 0.075% |
| 6+ months | 0.075% |

## Transmission

FMD is highly contagious:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Base transmission | 10% per infected animal |
| Close contact | Increases transmission |
| Shared facilities | Increases transmission |
| Quarantine | Reduces transmission |

!!! warning "Rapid Spread"
    FMD can quickly spread through an entire herd. Act fast when detected.

## Fatality

FMD fatality decreases over time as animals recover:

| Time (months) | Fatality Rate |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0 | 20% |
| 6 | 12% |
| 18 | 3.5% |

## Production Impact

FMD significantly reduces production:

| Output | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Milk | 35% of normal |
| Pallet production | 90% of normal |

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $250 |
| Duration | 3 months |

### Treatment Process

1. Identify infected animals
2. Isolate if possible
3. Administer treatment
4. Wait for recovery
5. Animal gains 24-month immunity

## Prevention

### Biosecurity Measures

| Measure | Effectiveness |
|---------|--------------|
| Quarantine new animals | High |
| Limit visitor access | Medium |
| Clean equipment | Medium |
| Separate species | Medium |

### Early Detection

Monitor for symptoms:

- Reduced production
- Lameness
- Fever
- Mouth lesions

## Economic Impact

### Direct Costs

| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Treatment | $250 per animal |
| Lost production | 65% milk loss during illness |
| Sale value | 50% reduction if sold while sick |

### Indirect Costs

- Potential herd-wide infection
- Movement restrictions
- Long recovery period

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Managing Foot and Mouth"
    1. **Biosecurity first** - Prevent introduction to your herd
    2. **Quick detection** - Monitor animals daily
    3. **Isolate immediately** - Separate sick animals
    4. **Treat aggressively** - Don't delay treatment
    5. **Cull considerations** - Severely affected animals may not be worth treating
    6. **Vaccination** - Consider for high-risk herds (if available)

## Multi-Species Considerations

FMD affects cattle, sheep, and pigs. If you have mixed species:

| Concern | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|
| Shared pastures | Separate species during outbreaks |
| Common water sources | Provide separate water |
| Equipment | Don't share between infected areas |
| Personnel | Change clothes between species |
