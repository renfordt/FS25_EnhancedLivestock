# Twin Lamb Disease (Pregnancy Toxemia / Ketosis)

Twin Lamb Disease occurs in late pregnancy when ewes carrying multiple lambs cannot eat enough energy to meet demands. Low blood sugar causes neurological symptoms progressing to coma and death. It has a **0.0 fertility modifier** meaning affected ewes cannot breed, and high mortality (20-40%) if untreated.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Sheep only |
| Transmission Rate | None (not contagious) |
| Immunity Period | 12 months |
| Recovery Time | With treatment only |
| Sale Value Impact | 50% reduction (0.5 multiplier) |
| **Fertility Impact** | **0% (0.0 multiplier) - cannot breed** |

!!! danger "Pregnancy-Only Disease - Destroys Fertility"
    Twin Lamb Disease ONLY affects pregnant ewes and sets fertility to 0.0, making breeding impossible while sick. Both ewe and unborn lambs are at extreme risk (40% mortality).

## Prerequisites

**MUST BE PREGNANT** - Cannot occur in non-pregnant ewes.

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| 0-11 (not breeding age) | 0% |
| 12+ (pregnant ewes) | 0.3% per month |

**Risk increases with**:
- Multiple lambs (twins/triplets)
- Poor body condition
- Late pregnancy (final 4-6 weeks)

**Health Genetics Modifier**: 1.75 health: 0.075% | 1.0: 0.3% | 0.25: 0.525%
**Overcrowding Modifier**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

### No Transmission

Metabolic disease - not contagious.

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Solid Manure | 50% |

### Fatality

| Time After Onset | Fatality Rate | Cumulative |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| Month 0 | 20% | 20% |
| Month 1 | 40% | ~52% total |

!!! danger "Rapid Progression"
    40% fatality in month 1. Both ewe and lambs often die. Untreated Twin Lamb Disease is a death sentence for over half of affected ewes.

## Disease Progression

1. **Active (Untreated)**: Not eating, drowsy, staggering, eventual coma. **Fertility = 0%** (cannot breed), 50% sale value reduction, 20-40% death risk, no natural recovery
2. **Being Treated**: $200 for 1 month (energy supplementation), after treatment: 12 months immunity, fertility restored
3. **Immune**: Normal production and breeding capability restored

**No Natural Recovery** - Treatment essential to save ewe and lambs.

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $200 |
| Duration | 1 month |
| Immunity | 12 months |

Treatment involves energy supplementation (propylene glycol, IV glucose) to correct low blood sugar.

!!! tip "Treatment is Life-Saving"
    $200 treatment reduces death from 52% to ~15% AND saves unborn lambs. Without treatment, both ewe and lambs usually die.

## Prevention

**Late Pregnancy Nutrition (Critical)**
- **Increase energy in final 6 weeks** - Energy needs triple in late pregnancy
- **Quality feed** - High-energy concentrates for ewes with twins
- **Small frequent meals** - Rumen capacity reduced by lambs

**Body Condition Management**
- **Target BCS 3-3.5 at mating** - Not too fat, not too thin
- **Monitor throughout pregnancy** - Adjust feed as needed
- **Avoid obesity** - Fat ewes can't eat enough in late pregnancy

**Stress Avoidance**
- **Don't move in late pregnancy** - Stress triggers disease
- **Don't shear in final weeks** - Cold stress dangerous
- **Minimize handling** - Avoid unnecessary stress
-**Daily checks** - Monitor closely in final weeks

**Ultrasound Scanning**
- **Scan for multiples** - Know which ewes carry twins/triplets
- **Separate high-risk ewes** - Give twins/triplets extra feed
- **Individual feeding** - Ensure multiples get adequate nutrition

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple lambs (twins/triplets) | Very high - energy demands exceed intake capacity |
| Obesity at breeding | High - can't eat enough in late pregnancy |
| Inadequate feed in late pregnancy | Critical |
| Stress (moving, shearing, cold) | High |
| Older ewes | Medium |
| Poor body condition | Medium |

## Economic Impact

**Single ewe with Twin Lamb Disease (treated):**
- Treatment: $200
- Death risk: ~15%
- Lambs saved if survives
- Expected cost: (0.85 × $200) + (0.15 × $200 ewe + $100 lambs) = $215

**Single ewe with Twin Lamb Disease (untreated):**
- Treatment: $0
- Death risk: ~52%
- Ewe + lambs both die
- Expected cost: 0.52 × ($200 ewe + $100 lambs) = $156 in losses

**But untreated = suffering and losing both ewe and lambs**

**Flock of 100 ewes, 3 develop Twin Lamb Disease:**
- Treatment: 3 × $200 = $600
- Deaths avoided: 3 × (52% - 15%) × $300 = $333
- Lambs saved: Priceless
- **Treatment prevents disaster**

**Prevention through scanning and nutrition:**
- Ultrasound scan: $3/ewe × 100 = $300
- Extra feed for 20 twins: $10/ewe × 20 = $200
- **Total prevention: $500 vs treatment+losses: $600-900**

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Twin Lamb Disease Prevention Protocol"
    **1. Ultrasound Scanning (Critical)**
       - Scan all ewes at 60-80 days pregnant
       - Identify twins/triplets
       - Separate and feed differently

    **2. Late Pregnancy Feeding**
       - Increase energy 6 weeks before lambing
       - Twins/triplets: concentrate feed daily
       - Quality hay always available
       - Small frequent meals

    **3. Body Condition Management**
       - Target BCS 3-3.5 at mating
       - Monitor monthly through pregnancy
       - Neither too fat nor too thin
       - Adjust feed to maintain condition

    **4. Minimize Stress**
       - No moving/transport in final 6 weeks
       - No shearing in final 4 weeks
       - Gentle handling only
       - Shelter from severe weather

    **5. Daily Monitoring (Final 4 Weeks)**
       - Check all ewes daily
       - Watch for: not eating, separation from flock, staggering
       - Early signs: treat immediately
       - Hours matter - rapid progression

    **6. Immediate Treatment**
       - At first signs (off feed, drowsy)
       - $200 treatment saves ewe and lambs
       - Reduces death from 52% to 15%
       - Fertility restored after recovery

    **7. High-Risk Ewe Management**
       - Ewes with twins/triplets: Extra feed
       - Fat ewes: Monitor closely
       - Older ewes: Watch carefully
       - Previous Twin Lamb Disease: High risk of recurrence

    **8. Post-Recovery**
       - 12 months immunity
       - Can breed again after recovery
       - May be prone to recurrence - manage carefully next pregnancy
