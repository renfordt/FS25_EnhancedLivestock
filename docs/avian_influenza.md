# Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)

Avian Influenza is the **most devastating disease in the game** with a catastrophic 65% immediate fatality rate, **highest transmission rate** (20%), complete egg production cessation, and **NO TREATMENT AVAILABLE**. Once introduced, it can destroy an entire flock within weeks. This is a flock-ending emergency.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens only |
| Transmission Rate | **20% per month (HIGHEST)** |
| Immunity Period | 24 months (longest, but only after surviving) |
| Recovery Time | 1 month (natural, if bird survives) |
| Sale Value Impact | **75% reduction (0.25 multiplier - WORST)** |

!!! danger "FLOCK DESTROYER - No Treatment Exists"
Avian Influenza combines:
- **65% immediate fatality** (deadliest chicken disease)
- **20% transmission** (highest in game - beats Newcastle's 15%)
- **0% egg production** (complete cessation)
- **NO TREATMENT AVAILABLE**
- Result: Flock destruction within weeks of introduction

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| All ages | 0.5% per month (high baseline) |

**Health Genetics**: 1.75: 0.125% | 1.0: 0.5% | 0.25: 0.875%
**Overcrowding**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

**Example - Overcrowded flock**: Average health, overcrowded:
- Base: 0.5% × 1.0 health × 2.0 overcrowding = **1.0% monthly chance**
- In a 100-bird flock: Expect ~1 case per month

### Transmission

**20% transmission** - THE HIGHEST in the entire game:
- Beats Newcastle and Infectious Bronchitis (15%)
- Spreads via all secretions, feces, feathers
- Airborne transmission
- Wild birds are primary vector
- Virus survives weeks in environment

**Explosive outbreak example**: 3 infected birds in 100-bird flock:
- Transmission: 20% × 3/100 = 0.6% per bird per month
- With modifiers: easily 1-2% per bird per month
- Month 1: 3 infected
- Month 2: 15 infected (20% transmission to 12 birds)
- Month 3: 40+ infected
- Month 4: 80+ infected
- **Entire flock infected within 3-4 months**

**Herd immunity**: >70% immune = 90% reduction (but requires 65%+ of flock to DIE first to build immunity - not a viable strategy)

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Egg Production (Pallets) | **0%** (complete cessation) |

!!! danger "Total Production Collapse"
Like Marek's Disease, Avian Flu causes **complete cessation** of egg production. Flocks become instantly economically nonviable.

### Fatality

| Time After Infection | Fatality Rate | Cumulative Deaths |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Month 0 | **65%** | **65%** |
| Month 3+ | 15% | **~71% total** |

!!! danger "Highest Chicken Mortality"
65% immediate fatality is THE HIGHEST for any chicken disease. For comparison:
- Newcastle: 40% immediate
- Marek's: 10% immediate
- Coccidiosis: 20% immediate
- **Avian Flu: 65% immediate - nearly 2x worse than Newcastle**

## Disease Progression

1. **Active (Untreated)**: Severe respiratory distress, sudden death, swollen head, purple discoloration of combs/wattles, 0% egg production, **65% immediate death**
2. **NO TREATMENT AVAILABLE**
3. **Natural Recovery (Survivors Only)**: After 1 month, 75% chance of recovery. Grants 24-month immunity.

**Only Options**:
- **Depopulate entire flock** - Industry standard response
- **Let nature take its course** - 65%+ die, survivors develop immunity but flock destroyed
- **Culling is humane and prevents spread**

## Treatment

**NO TREATMENT EXISTS**

| Treatment | Available |
|-----------|-----------|
| Medicine | No |
| Cure | No |

**Management**: Complete flock depopulation is standard industry response. Individual culling cannot stop 20% transmission.

## Prevention

**Biosecurity (CRITICAL - Only Defense)**
- **Wild bird exclusion** - PRIMARY introduction route
    - Complete netting over outdoor areas
    - Covered feeders/waterers (no wild bird access)
    - No open water sources
    - Scare tactics for wild birds
- **Strict quarantine** - 30+ days for ANY new birds
- **All-in/all-out** - Never continuous production
- **Visitor control** - Strict protocols, foot baths, hand washing
- **Equipment isolation** - Never share between flocks

**Vaccination (Where Available)**
- Some jurisdictions allow vaccination
- May not be represented in game mechanics
- Check local regulations

**Surveillance**
- **Monitor wild bird populations** - Die-offs are early warning
- **Daily health checks** - Early detection critical
- **Immediate reporting** - Avian flu is reportable disease
- **Isolation of sick birds** - Though likely futile given 20% transmission

**Environmental**
- **Sanitation** - Clean and disinfect thoroughly
- **Pest control** - Rodents can carry virus
- **Avoid contamination** - Water, feed, equipment

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Wild bird contact | CRITICAL - primary introduction route |
| Outdoor access | Very high - wild bird exposure |
| Poor biosecurity | Critical - 20% transmission spreads instantly |
| No wild bird barriers | Critical |
| Waterfowl nearby | Very high - natural reservoir |
| Migratory bird flyway | High - seasonal introduction risk |
| Overcrowding | Doubles risk |

## Economic Impact

**Single bird with Avian Flu:**
- Treatment: $0 (none exists)
- Egg production: 0% (complete loss)
- Death risk: **65%**
- Expected outcome: Bird dies or is culled
- **Complete loss: $10/bird**

**Flock of 100 birds, 5 initially infected (NO intervention):**
- Month 1: 5 infected, 5 × 65% = 3.25 dead = $32.50 lost
- Transmission: 20% × 5/100 = 1% per bird → 10 more infected
- Month 2: 15 infected, 15 × 65% = 9.75 dead = $97.50 lost cumulative
- Transmission: 20% × 15/100 = 3% per bird → 30 more infected
- Month 3: 45 infected, 45 × 65% = 29 dead = $290 lost cumulative
- Transmission continues exponentially
- Month 6: Entire flock infected, 65+ birds dead, survivors with 0% production
- **Total loss: $650-800 (entire flock value)**

**Flock depopulation (industry standard):**
- Immediate culling of entire 100-bird flock
- Loss: 100 × $10 = $1,000
- Prevents spread to other flocks
- Clean and disinfect facility
- Restock with new birds after quarantine period
- **Loss: $1,000 but prevents regional spread**

**Prevention (wild bird barriers):**
- Netting outdoor areas: $500 one-time
- Covered feeders: $200
- Biosecurity upgrades: $300
- **Total: $1,000 one-time vs. $1,000 flock loss + potential repeated outbreaks**

### True Cost

| Scenario | Immediate Loss | Long-Term Impact |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| No prevention, outbreak | $650-1,000 (flock destroyed) | Facility contamination, months to restart |
| Prevention (wild bird barriers) | $1,000 one-time | Ongoing protection |
| Depopulation (if infected) | $1,000 (entire flock) | Prevents regional spread, regulatory compliance |

!!! danger "Avian Flu Can End Your Poultry Operation"
With 65% mortality and 20% transmission, Avian Flu doesn't just kill birds - it makes poultry farming impossible until the outbreak is resolved. This is not a disease you manage - it's a disease you prevent at all costs or depopulate immediately.

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Avian Flu Prevention and Emergency Protocol"
**1. Prevention is THE ONLY Strategy**
- NO treatment exists
- Once introduced, flock is doomed
- 20% transmission + 65% mortality = flock destruction
- **Prevention is not optional - it's survival**

    **2. Wild Bird Barriers (CRITICAL)**
       - Complete netting of outdoor areas
       - No gaps, no exceptions
       - Covered feeders/waterers (zero wild bird access)
       - Remove any open water sources
       - Bird scare tactics (noise, visual)
       - **This is your ONLY defense**

    **3. Biosecurity (Non-Negotiable)**
       - Quarantine ALL new birds 30+ days (preferably off-site)
       - Strict visitor control
       - Foot baths with fresh disinfectant daily
       - Hand washing before entering coops
       - Never share equipment with other flocks
       - Change clothes/boots before entering

    **4. Surveillance**
       - Daily health checks of entire flock
       - Watch for sudden deaths
       - Monitor wild bird populations for die-offs
       - Regional outbreak awareness
       - **Early detection = early depopulation = less suffering**

    **5. If Avian Flu Detected**
       - **Immediately report to authorities** (legally required in most jurisdictions)
       - **Immediately depopulate entire flock** - do not delay
       - 20% transmission means whole flock is exposed
       - 65% will die anyway - depopulation is humane
       - Prevents spread to neighboring flocks
       - Regulatory compliance

    **6. Depopulation Protocol**
       - Humane culling of entire flock same day
       - Do NOT sell or move any birds
       - Carcass disposal per regulations (burial/incineration)
       - Complete disinfection of facility
       - Remove all organic matter
       - Rest facility 30+ days minimum

    **7. Restocking**
       - Only after facility fully disinfected
       - Only after regulatory clearance
       - Source birds from AI-free facilities
       - Maintain strict biosecurity from day 1
       - Never assume "it won't happen again"

    **8. Regional Awareness**
       - Monitor for outbreaks in area
       - Wild bird migration patterns
       - Heightened biosecurity during high-risk seasons
       - Communication with other poultry farmers
       - Shared surveillance information

    **9. Accept Reality**
       - No treatment = no cure
       - 65% die regardless
       - 20% transmission = entire flock infected
       - Depopulation is standard industry response
       - This is not a disease you fight - it's one you prevent

    **10. Legal/Regulatory**
       - Avian Influenza is notifiable disease
       - Must report to animal health authorities
       - Quarantine and movement restrictions apply
       - Compensation programs may exist
       - Follow all official guidance
