# Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)

Avian Influenza is a highly contagious and often fatal disease affecting chickens and other poultry.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens |
| Transmission Rate | 20% |
| Immunity Period | 24 months |
| Recovery Time | 1 month |
| Sale Value Impact | 75% reduction |

!!! danger "High Transmission"
    Avian Influenza has the highest transmission rate of any disease in Enhanced Livestock at 20% per infected bird.

## Probability

Avian Influenza can affect chickens of any age:

| Age | Probability |
|-----|-------------|
| All ages | 0.5% base chance |

## Fatality

Avian Influenza has high mortality:

| Time (months) | Fatality Rate |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0 | 65% |
| 3 | 15% |

### Survival Chances

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| Death in first month | 65% |
| Death by month 3 | ~80% total |
| Survival | ~20% |

## Production Impact

Infected birds stop producing:

| Output | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Eggs/Pallets | 0% (complete stop) |

## Treatment

!!! warning "No Treatment"
    There is no treatment available for Avian Influenza. Prevention is the only defense.

| Treatment | Available |
|-----------|-----------|
| Medicine | No |
| Vaccination | No |

## Prevention

### Biosecurity is Critical

| Measure | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Limit wild bird contact | Critical |
| Secure housing | Critical |
| Quarantine new birds | High |
| Clean equipment | High |
| Limit visitors | Medium |

### Housing Design

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Enclosed coops | Prevents wild bird contact |
| Screened ventilation | Allows airflow, blocks birds |
| Clean water sources | Prevents contamination |
| Separate from wild areas | Reduces exposure |

## Economic Impact

### Severe Losses

Avian Influenza can devastate a flock:

| Impact | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| Mortality | Up to 65-80% of flock |
| Production stop | Complete during outbreak |
| Sale value | 75% reduction if sold sick |

### Cost Analysis

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Bird losses | High percentage of flock |
| No production | Duration of outbreak |
| Depopulation | May need to cull entire flock |
| Facility cleaning | Required before restocking |

## Outbreak Management

!!! danger "Outbreak Protocol"
    1. **Isolate immediately** - Separate from healthy birds
    2. **Stop all movement** - Don't move birds in or out
    3. **Monitor closely** - Track spread daily
    4. **Consider depopulation** - May be necessary to stop spread
    5. **Deep clean** - Before any restocking
    6. **Wait period** - Allow time before new birds

### Depopulation Decision

| Consider Culling When | Reason |
|----------------------|--------|
| High infection rate | Disease spreading rapidly |
| Valuable breeding stock nearby | Protect uninfected birds |
| Unable to isolate | No way to contain |
| Economic calculation | Losses exceed value |

## Prevention Strategy

!!! tip "Protecting Your Flock"
    1. **Biosecurity always** - Don't wait for an outbreak
    2. **Cover runs** - Prevent wild bird access
    3. **Dedicated clothing** - Use separate boots/clothes
    4. **Water sources** - Keep clean and covered
    5. **New bird quarantine** - Always isolate newcomers
    6. **Monitor wild birds** - Be aware of regional outbreaks
    7. **Quick response** - Act immediately if suspected

## Regional Considerations

Avian Influenza often spreads regionally through wild bird populations:

| Season | Risk Level |
|--------|-----------|
| Spring/Fall migration | Higher |
| Summer/Winter | Lower |

Monitor news for outbreaks in your area and increase biosecurity during high-risk periods.
