# Coccidiosis

Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease caused by *Eimeria* species that damage the intestinal lining, causing bloody droppings, huddled posture, and high chick mortality (20% initial fatality). Young birds are extremely vulnerable, with risk decreasing dramatically as they mature and develop immunity.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens only |
| Transmission Rate | 10% per month (high) |
| Immunity Period | 12 months |
| Recovery Time | 3 months (natural) |
| Sale Value Impact | 45% reduction (0.55 multiplier) |
| Seasonal Pattern | Spring/Summer 1.5x, Winter 0.5x |

!!! warning "Chick Killer - Age-Dependent Risk"
    Young chicks (0-6 months) have a 0.5% base risk - 5x higher than adult birds. Spring/summer seasonal increase compounds this to create extreme chick vulnerability.

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability | Risk Level |
|--------------|------------------|------------|
| 0-5 | 0.5% per month | Very high (5x adult) |
| 6-11 | 0.2% per month | Medium (2x adult) |
| 12+ | 0.1% per month | Low (baseline) |

**Health Genetics**: 1.75: 0.125% (young) | 1.0: 0.5% | 0.25: 0.875%
**Seasonal**: Spring/Summer 1.5x | Autumn 1.0x | Winter 0.5x
**Overcrowding**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

**Example**: Young chick (0-6 months), average health, summer, overcrowded:
- Base: 0.5% × 1.0 health × 1.5 summer × 2.0 overcrowding = **1.5% monthly chance**

### Transmission

10% transmission rate spreads rapidly through contaminated litter:
- Oocysts shed in droppings contaminate bedding
- Birds ingest oocysts while pecking
- Parasites damage gut lining
- More oocysts shed, cycle repeats

**Herd immunity**: >70% immune = 90% transmission reduction

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Egg Production (Pallets) | 30% (70% reduction) |

### Fatality

| Time | Fatality Rate | Cumulative |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Month 0 | 20% | 20% |
| Month 2 | 5% | ~24% total |

!!! danger "Chick Mortality"
    20% immediate fatality primarily affects young chicks. This is one of the highest mortality rates for poultry diseases in the game.

## Disease Progression

1. **Active**: Bloody droppings, huddled appearance, 70% egg loss, 20% initial death risk
2. **Being Treated**: $30 for 1 month (anticoccidial drugs)
3. **Immune**: Normal production, 12-month immunity

**Natural Recovery**: After 3 months, 75% chance of recovery/month. Risky for young chicks due to high mortality.

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $30 (very affordable) |
| Duration | 1 month |
| Immunity | 12 months |

!!! tip "Treat Immediately"
    $30 is extremely affordable. Reduces death from 24% to ~8% and prevents 70% egg production loss.

## Prevention

**Litter Management (Critical)**
- **Keep litter DRY** - Moisture allows oocyst sporulation
- **Deep clean between flocks** - Remove all contaminated bedding
- **Fresh bedding** - Replace regularly, especially after rain
- **Good ventilation** - Reduces moisture buildup

**Coccidiostat in Feed**
- **Medicated starter feed** - Prevents coccidiosis in chicks
- **Gradual immunity development** - Low-level exposure builds resistance
- **Withdraw before slaughter** - Follow withdrawal periods

**Biosecurity**
- **All-in/all-out** - Clean and disinfect between flocks
- **Avoid overcrowding** - <80% capacity
- **Age segregation** - Don't mix young and old birds

**Environmental**
- **Drainage** - Prevent wet spots
- **Roofing** - Keep rain out of outdoor areas
- **Regular cleaning** - Don't let manure accumulate

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Young age (0-6 months) | 5x baseline |
| Wet litter | Critical - enables oocyst development |
| Spring/Summer | 1.5x (warm + wet) |
| Overcrowding | 2.0x |
| Poor hygiene | Very high |
| Mixing age groups | High |

## Economic Impact

**Chick with coccidiosis (treated):**
- Treatment: $30
- Production loss: Minimal (chicks don't lay yet)
- Death risk: ~8%
- Expected cost: (0.92 × $30) + (0.08 × $5 chick) = ~$28

**Layer with coccidiosis (treated):**
- Treatment: $30
- Egg loss: 1 month at 70% = ~$10 lost
- Death risk: ~8%
- Expected cost: $30 + $10 = $40

**Flock of 100 chicks, 10 infected (untreated):**
- Deaths: 10 × 20% = 2 chicks = $10 lost
- Transmission: 10% × 10/100 = 1% per chick → 5-10 more infected
- Cascade effect
- **vs. treating 10: 10 × $30 = $300, prevents deaths and spread**

**Prevention (medicated feed):**
- Cost: ~$0.50/bird extra for medicated starter
- Prevents nearly all cases
- **$50 prevention vs $300+ treatment costs**

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Coccidiosis Control Protocol"
    **1. Litter Management (Most Important)**
       - Keep bedding DRY at all times
       - Deep clean between flocks
       - Replace wet spots immediately
       - Good ventilation to control moisture

    **2. Medicated Starter Feed**
       - Use for all chicks 0-6 months
       - Allows controlled immunity development
       - Much cheaper than treating outbreaks
       - Follow withdrawal times before slaughter

    **3. Age-Specific Risk**
       - Chicks 0-6 months: Extremely high risk
       - Young birds 6-12 months: Medium risk
       - Adults 12+: Low risk
       - Focus prevention on youngest birds

    **4. Seasonal Awareness**
       - Spring/Summer: 1.5x risk (warm + wet)
       - Extra vigilance in wet seasons
       - Ensure excellent drainage

    **5. Immediate Treatment**
       - $30 is very affordable
       - Reduces death from 24% to 8%
       - Prevents 70% egg production loss
       - Stops transmission (10% rate)

    **6. All-In/All-Out**
       - Don't continuously add new birds
       - Clean completely between flocks
       - Prevents oocyst buildup

    **7. Monitor Young Birds**
       - Check chicks daily
       - Watch for: bloody droppings, huddling, ruffled feathers
       - Early treatment critical for survival
