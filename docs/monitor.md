# Animal Monitors

Enhanced Livestock includes a subscription-based monitoring system that lets you track detailed statistics for individual animals.

## Overview

Monitors are virtual tracking subscriptions you can apply to individual animals. When an animal has a monitor applied, you gain access to detailed real-time information about that animal's health, weight, food consumption, and production output.

## Applying Monitors

### From the Animal Screen

1. Open the in-game menu and navigate to **Animals**
2. Select a husbandry and click on an animal
3. Click **Apply Monitor** to enable monitoring for that animal
4. Click **Remove Monitor** to disable monitoring

### Bulk Operations

From the husbandry overview in the Enhanced Livestock frame, you can:

- **Apply All Monitors** - Enable monitoring for all animals in the husbandry
- **Remove All Monitors** - Disable monitoring for all animals

## Viewing Monitor Data

When a monitor is applied to an animal:

### In-Game Popup (HUD)

When you approach a monitored animal in the game world, an information popup automatically appears showing:

| Data | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Monitor fee | Monthly subscription cost |
| Health | Current health percentage |
| Lactating | Whether the animal is lactating (dairy animals only) |
| Weight | Current weight in kg |
| Target weight | Expected weight based on genetics |
| Value per kilo | Current sale value per kg |
| Food inputs | Daily consumption by feed type |
| Production outputs | Daily production by output type |

### Genetics Popup

A separate popup always shows the animal's genetic traits when approaching any animal (monitored or not).

### Disease Popup

If the animal has diseases and the disease system is enabled, a third popup shows current disease status.

## Monthly Subscription Fee

Monitoring is not free. Each monitored animal incurs a monthly fee:

- Fee is calculated based on animal size (height × radius × 15)
- Larger animals cost more to monitor
- Fees are deducted automatically at the start of each month
- Appears in finances as **Monitor Subscriptions**

| Animal Type | Approximate Monthly Fee |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Chickens | ~€0.25 |
| Sheep/Goats | ~€2-3 |
| Pigs | ~€3-4 |
| Cattle | ~€4-6 |
| Horses | ~€5-7 |

## Visual Indicator

Monitored animals display a visual indicator on their 3D model (when the animal model supports it), making them easy to identify in the husbandry.

## Use Cases

!!! tip "When to Use Monitors"
    - **Breeding stock** - Track genetics and reproduction on valuable animals
    - **Performance tracking** - Monitor food efficiency and production output
    - **Health management** - Keep close watch on animals recovering from disease
    - **Weight optimization** - Track weight gain for optimal slaughter timing

!!! info "Cost vs. Benefit"
    Monitoring every animal can become expensive. Focus monitors on high-value breeding stock or animals you're actively managing for specific outcomes.
