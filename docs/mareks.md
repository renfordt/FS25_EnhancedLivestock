# Marek's Disease

Marek's Disease is a highly contagious viral cancer causing tumors in nerves and organs. The classic symptom is paralysis with one leg forward and one back. There is **NO CURE** - prevention through vaccination is the only defense.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens only |
| Transmission Rate | 8% per month |
| Immunity Period | 24 months (longest) |
| Recovery Time | **None - INCURABLE** |
| Sale Value Impact | 80% reduction (0.2 multiplier) |

!!! danger "No Treatment Available - Vaccination Only"
    Marek's Disease has NO treatment. Once infected, chickens progressively deteriorate and die. Culling is the only option. Vaccination at day-of-hatch is CRITICAL.

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| All ages | 0.1% per month |

**Health Genetics**: 1.75: 0.025% | 1.0: 0.1% | 0.25: 0.175%
**Overcrowding**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

### Transmission

8% transmission via feather dust and dander:
- Virus shed in feather follicles
- Becomes airborne in dust
- Extremely hardy - survives months in environment
- Spreads rapidly in enclosed spaces

**Herd immunity**: >70% immune = 90% reduction (but immunity only from vaccination, not infection)

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Egg Production | 0% (complete cessation) |

### Fatality

Progressive cancer with increasing mortality:

| Time | Fatality Rate | Cumulative |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Month 0 | 10% | 10% |
| Month 3 | 20% | ~28% total |
| Month 6 | 30% | ~48% total |

!!! warning "Progressive Disease"
    Tumors grow over time, causing paralysis, organ failure, and death. Most infected birds eventually die.

## Disease Progression

1. **Active (Untreated)**: Paralysis, tumors, 0% egg production, progressive death (10% → 30%)
2. **NO TREATMENT AVAILABLE**
3. **NO NATURAL RECOVERY**

**Only Options**:
- **Cull immediately** - Prevents spread, ends suffering
- **Leave untreated** - Slow death, continues spreading virus

## Treatment

**NO TREATMENT EXISTS**

| Treatment | Available |
|-----------|-----------|
| Medicine | No |
| Cure | No |
| Natural Recovery | No |

**Management**: Cull infected birds immediately to prevent spread.

## Prevention

**Vaccination at Hatch (CRITICAL)**
- **Day-old vaccination** - Most effective when done at hatch
- **In ovo vaccination** - Can vaccinate in egg before hatching
- **Lifelong immunity** - One vaccination protects for life
- **Essential for all flocks** - Not optional

**Biosecurity**
- **All-in/all-out** - Prevents virus accumulation
- **Clean between flocks** - Remove all bedding and dust
- **Control feather dust** - Good ventilation, frequent cleaning
- **Limit visitors** - Virus spreads on shoes, clothing

**Environmental**
- **Reduce dust** - Mist systems, oil-based dust suppressants
- **Frequent cleaning** - Remove dust and dander buildup
- **Avoid mixing flocks** - Don't add birds to existing flock

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Unvaccinated birds | CRITICAL - nearly certain infection |
| Feather dust accumulation | Very high |
| Mixed-age flocks | High |
| Poor cleaning | High |
| Overcrowding | Doubles risk |
| Continuous production | High - virus accumulates |

## Economic Impact

**Infected bird (no treatment available):**
- Treatment: $0 (none exists)
- Egg production: 0% (complete loss)
- Death risk: ~48% by month 6
- Sale value: 80% reduction (if sold early)
- **Must cull - total loss**

**Flock of 100 birds, 5 infected:**
- 5 birds must be culled = 5 × $10 = $50 lost
- Transmission: 8% × 5/100 = 0.4% per bird per month
- Potential spread to 10-15 more birds over 6 months
- **Unchecked = flock destruction**

**Prevention (vaccination):**
- Cost: ~$0.25/chick at hatch
- 100 chicks × $0.25 = $25
- Prevents nearly all cases
- **$25 prevention vs. $500+ flock losses**

### True Cost

| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Vaccination (100 chicks) | $25 |
| Unvaccinated flock outbreak (20 infected) | 20 birds × $10 = $200 lost + spread |
| Complete flock loss | 100 × $10 = $1,000 |

!!! danger "Marek's Can Destroy an Entire Flock"
    Without vaccination, Marek's can infect 30-50% of a flock, killing nearly half of infected birds. This can make chicken farming economically nonviable.

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Marek's Disease Prevention Protocol"
    **1. Vaccination is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
       - Vaccinate ALL chicks at day-of-hatch
       - $0.25/chick is cheap insurance
       - Provides lifelong immunity
       - ONLY reliable protection

    **2. NO Treatment Exists**
       - Infected birds CANNOT be cured
       - Cull immediately upon diagnosis
       - Don't waste time/money trying to save them
       - Prevents suffering and spread

    **3. Immediate Culling**
       - Remove infected birds same day
       - Prevents virus spread through feather dust
       - Reduces flock exposure
       - Humane - prevents slow death from cancer

    **4. Dust Control**
       - Marek's spreads via feather dander
       - Good ventilation essential
       - Frequent cleaning of dust
       - Misting systems in dusty conditions

    **5. All-In/All-Out Management**
       - Don't continuously add new birds
       - Clean completely between flocks
       - Prevents virus accumulation in environment
       - Break infection cycles

    **6. Biosecurity**
       - Control farm access
       - Foot baths and hand washing
       - Don't share equipment between flocks
       - Quarantine any new birds (even if vaccinated)

    **7. Accept Reality**
       - No treatment = no recovery
       - Vaccination is the ONLY protection
       - Infected birds are a total loss
       - Fast action limits damage

    **8. Monitor for Signs**
       - Paralysis (classic "splits" - legs in opposite directions)
       - Wing droop
       - Twisted neck
       - Weight loss
       - Complete egg production cessation
       - Cull immediately if observed
