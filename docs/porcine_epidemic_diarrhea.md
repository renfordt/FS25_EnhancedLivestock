# Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED)

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea is a devastating viral disease that primarily affects young pigs with extremely high mortality rates in piglets.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Pigs only |
| Transmission Rate | 7.5% |
| Immunity Period | 12 months |
| Recovery Time | 3 months |
| Sale Value Impact | 35% reduction |

## Age-Based Probability

PED probability is highest in young animals:

| Age | Probability |
|-----|-------------|
| 0-6 months | 12.5% (extremely high) |
| 6-18 months | 5% |
| 18-24 months | 1% |
| 24+ months | 0.1% |

!!! danger "Piglet Vulnerability"
    Young piglets are extremely susceptible to PED. This is one of the most dangerous diseases for pig operations.

## Fatality

PED has very high fatality in young animals:

| Time (months) | Fatality Rate |
|---------------|---------------|
| 0 | 85% |
| 1 | 7.5% |
| 2 | 0.025% |

### Age-Based Fatality

| Age Group | Mortality Risk |
|-----------|---------------|
| Piglets (<6 months) | Very High |
| Growing pigs | Moderate |
| Adult pigs | Low |

## Production Impact

PED dramatically affects waste output (due to diarrhea):

| Output | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Liquid Manure | 400% (4x increase) |
| Solid Manure | 25% of normal |

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $150 |
| Duration | 1 month |

### Treatment Considerations

- Early treatment is critical for survival
- Adult pigs have better prognosis
- Piglets may not survive even with treatment

## Prevention

### Critical Measures

| Measure | Priority |
|---------|----------|
| Biosecurity | Critical |
| Quarantine new animals | Critical |
| Clean farrowing areas | High |
| Separate age groups | High |

### Farrowing Management

Protect pregnant sows and newborn piglets:

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| All-in/all-out farrowing | Reduces transmission |
| Clean between batches | Eliminates virus |
| Limit personnel access | Reduces introduction |

## Economic Impact

### Devastating Losses

| Impact | Severity |
|--------|----------|
| Piglet mortality | Up to 85% in outbreaks |
| Sow losses | Moderate |
| Production disruption | Severe |

### Cost Analysis

| Cost Factor | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Treatment | $150 per pig |
| Piglet losses | 85% mortality potential |
| Production loss | Weeks to months |
| Facility cleaning | Variable |

## Management Strategy

!!! warning "PED Emergency Protocol"
    1. **Isolate immediately** - Separate affected animals
    2. **Protect piglets** - Move unaffected young away
    3. **Treat adults first** - They have better survival rates
    4. **Deep clean** - PED virus is hardy
    5. **Delay farrowing** - Don't introduce new piglets during outbreak
    6. **Review biosecurity** - Identify how virus entered

## Long-Term Management

### Building Herd Immunity

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Controlled exposure | Adults develop immunity |
| Timing | Not during farrowing |
| Monitoring | Track immunity status |

### Facility Design

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Separate farrowing | Protects piglets |
| Multiple buildings | Limits spread |
| Easy cleaning | Reduces persistence |
| Quarantine area | Isolates new animals |
