# Newcastle Disease

Newcastle Disease is an acute viral disease affecting respiratory, nervous, and digestive systems simultaneously. Symptoms include twisted necks, gasping, and paralysis. With the **highest transmission rate** (15%) and catastrophic 40% immediate fatality, Newcastle is one of the most devastating poultry diseases.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Chickens only |
| Transmission Rate | **15% per month (HIGHEST)** |
| Immunity Period | 18 months |
| Recovery Time | 2 months (natural) |
| Sale Value Impact | 70% reduction (0.3 multiplier) |

!!! danger "Highest Transmission - 40% Immediate Fatality"
    Newcastle has the HIGHEST transmission rate of any disease (15%). Combined with 40% immediate mortality, an outbreak can devastate an entire flock within weeks.

## Infection Risk

###Base Probability

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| All ages | 0.1% per month |

**Health Genetics**: 1.75: 0.025% | 1.0: 0.1% | 0.25: 0.175%
**Overcrowding**: >100%: 2.0x | 80-100%: 1.3x | <50%: 0.8x

### Transmission

**15% transmission** - the highest in the game - creates explosive outbreaks:
- Spreads via all secretions: respiratory, fecal, ocular
- Airborne transmission
- Wild birds are major vector
- Extremely contagious

**Example outbreak**: 5 infected birds in 100-bird flock:
- Transmission chance: 15% × 5/100 = 0.75% per bird per month
- With health/overcrowding modifiers: easily 1-2% per bird
- 10-20 more birds infected per month
- **Flock-wide outbreak in 2-3 months without intervention**

**Herd immunity**: >70% immune = 90% reduction (but must vaccinate - natural immunity after 40% die)

## Symptoms and Effects

| Output Type | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| Egg Production | 10% (90% reduction) |

!!! danger "Near-Complete Production Collapse"
    90% egg production loss is one of the most severe production penalties. Flocks become economically nonviable during outbreaks.

### Fatality

| Time | Fatality Rate | Cumulative |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Month 0 | **40%** | **40%** |
| Month 2 | 15% | ~49% total |

!!! danger "Catastrophic Mortality"
    40% immediate fatality is the second-highest initial death rate in the game (after Clostridial in sheep at 70%). Nearly half of all infected birds die.

## Disease Progression

1. **Active (Untreated)**: Twisted neck, gasping, paralysis, greenish diarrhea, 90% egg loss, 40% immediate death, 15% ongoing death risk
2. **Being Treated**: $40 for 1 month, reduces death risk, production penalties continue during treatment
3. **Immune (Recovered)**: Normal production, 18-month immunity

**Natural Recovery**: After 2 months, 75% chance of recovery/month. Extremely risky due to 49% total mortality.

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cost | $40 (very affordable) |
| Duration | 1 month |
| Immunity | 18 months |

!!! tip "Treat Immediately Despite Low Cost"
    $40 is cheap, but with 15% transmission and 40% mortality, the real cost is flock devastation. Treatment reduces death risk and stops spread.

## Prevention

**Vaccination (CRITICAL)**
- **Regular vaccination** - Annual boosters
- **Day-old chicks** - Vaccinate early
- **Entire flock** - 100% coverage essential
- **Only reliable prevention**

**Biosecurity (Essential)**
- **Wild bird exclusion** - CRITICAL - wild birds spread Newcastle
- **Netting over outdoor areas** - Prevent wild bird contact
- **Covered feeders/waterers** - No wild bird contamination
- **Control farm access** - Strict visitor protocols

**Quarantine**
- **Isolate new birds** - 30-day quarantine minimum
- **Never introduce unvaccinated birds**
- **Test before introduction**

**Environmental**
- **All-in/all-out** - Clean completely between flocks
- **Disinfection** - Virus survives months in environment
- **Equipment hygiene** - Don't share between flocks

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Unvaccinated flock | CRITICAL - outbreak nearly certain |
| Wild bird contact | CRITICAL - major introduction route |
| Poor biosecurity | Very high - 15% transmission spreads rapidly |
| Overcrowding | Doubles risk |
| Multi-species farm | High - increases wild bird attraction |
| No quarantine | High |

## Economic Impact

**Single bird with Newcastle (treated):**
- Treatment: $40
- Egg loss: 1 month at 90% = ~$15 lost
- Death risk: ~25% (reduced from 40%)
- Expected cost: (0.75 × $40) + (0.25 × $10) = ~$32.50 + $15 eggs = $47.50

**Flock outbreak (100 birds, 10 infected, no treatment):**
- Deaths: 10 × 40% = 4 birds = $40 lost immediately
- Transmission: 15% × 10/100 = 1.5% per bird per month
- Month 2: 15 more infected
- Month 3: 30 more infected
- Total infected by month 4: 55+ birds
- Total deaths: 55 × 40% = 22 birds = $220 lost
- **Flock destruction: $220+ deaths + complete production collapse**

**Flock outbreak (100 birds, 10 infected, immediate treatment):**
- Treatment: 10 × $40 = $400
- Deaths: 10 × 25% = 2.5 birds = $25
- Transmission reduced during treatment
- Additional infections: ~5 birds
- Additional treatment: 5 × $40 = $200
- **Total cost: $600 treatment + $37.50 deaths = ~$637.50 vs $220+ deaths alone (untreated)**

**Prevention (vaccination):**
- Cost: 100 birds × $1/year = $100
- Prevents nearly all cases
- **$100 prevention vs $600-1,000+ outbreak**

### True Cost of Newcastle

| Scenario | Deaths | Production Loss | Total Cost |
|----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| No vaccination, outbreak | 20-40% of flock | 90% for months | $500-1,000+ |
| Vaccination | <1% | Minimal | $100/year |
| Outbreak + treatment | 10-25% | 90% for 1-2 months | $600-800 |

!!! danger "Newcastle Can End Your Operation"
    A Newcastle outbreak with 15% transmission and 40% mortality can make poultry farming economically nonviable. Prevention through vaccination is not optional.

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Newcastle Disease Prevention and Control Protocol"
    **1. Vaccination is MANDATORY**
       - Vaccinate 100% of flock annually
       - Boosters as recommended
       - Day-old chicks included
       - ONLY reliable protection against 15% transmission

    **2. Wild Bird Exclusion (Critical)**
       - Newcastle spread primarily by wild birds
       - Net outdoor areas completely
       - Covered feeders and waterers
       - No open water sources accessible to wild birds
       - Scare tactics (noise, visual deterrents)

    **3. Biosecurity**
       - Strict farm access control
       - Foot baths with fresh disinfectant daily
       - Hand washing before entering coops
       - No shared equipment between flocks
       - Quarantine ALL new birds 30 days

    **4. Early Detection**
       - Watch for: twisted neck, gasping, greenish diarrhea
       - Sudden egg production drop
       - Respiratory distress
       - Newcastle progresses FAST - hours matter

    **5. Immediate Isolation**
       - Separate sick birds immediately
       - 15% transmission means explosive spread
       - Treat entire affected group simultaneously
       - Don't wait to see if more get sick

    **6. Immediate Treatment**
       - $40 is cheap for life-saving intervention
       - Reduces death from 40% to 25%
       - Reduces transmission during treatment
       - Treat all showing symptoms same day

    **7. Outbreak Protocol**
       - If >10% of flock infected: treat entire flock
       - 15% transmission = everyone exposed
       - Mass treatment cheaper than serial infections
       - May need to depopulate in extreme cases

    **8. Post-Outbreak**
       - Complete cleaning and disinfection
       - Rest facility 2+ weeks
       - Restock with vaccinated birds only
       - Review biosecurity - how did it enter?

    **9. Regulatory Compliance**
       - Newcastle is reportable in many jurisdictions
       - May require official veterinarian involvement
       - Quarantine restrictions may apply
       - Follow local regulations
