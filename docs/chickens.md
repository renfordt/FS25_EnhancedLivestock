# Chickens

Chickens are small, efficient livestock ideal for egg production with minimal space and investment requirements.

## Breeds

### Standard Chicken

| Property | Female (Hen) | Male (Rooster) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Target Weight | 3.25 kg | 4.25 kg |
| Max Weight | 4.5 kg | 5.5 kg |
| Birth Weight | 0.04 kg | 0.045 kg |

## Reproduction

### Fertility
Chickens mature quickly and can begin laying eggs at approximately 6 months.

### Breeding
- **Incubation period:** 21 days
- **Eggs per clutch:** Variable
- **Minimum health for breeding:** 75%

!!! info "Rapid Reproduction"
    Chickens have the fastest reproduction cycle of all livestock, allowing for quick flock expansion.

## Production

### Egg Production
Hens produce eggs consistently when healthy:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Age 6-18 months | Peak production |
| Health | Higher health = more eggs |
| Nutrition | Proper feed increases output |
| Genetics | Productivity trait affects yield |

### Pallet Production
Chicken coops produce egg pallets that can be sold:

- Automatic collection into pallets
- Pallet value based on quantity and quality
- Affected by hen genetics

### Manure
Chicken manure is produced in smaller quantities but is high in nitrogen:

| Output | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Manure | Low per bird |

## Input Requirements

Chickens are efficient and require minimal inputs:

| Input | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Feed | Grain-based feed |
| Water | Fresh water |
| Space | Minimal per bird |

## Common Diseases

- [Avian Influenza](avian_influenza.md) - Highly contagious and often fatal

!!! warning "Disease Risk"
    Avian influenza spreads rapidly through flocks with high transmission rates. Monitor your chickens closely.

## Chicken Management

### Flock Composition

| Ratio | Recommendation |
|-------|---------------|
| Roosters to Hens | 1:10-15 for breeding |
| Layers only | No roosters needed for eggs |

### Housing Considerations

| Factor | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| Protection | Secure from predators |
| Ventilation | Good airflow |
| Lighting | Affects laying cycle |
| Nesting | Adequate nest boxes |

## Economic Considerations

### Advantages
- **Low startup cost** - Cheapest livestock to begin with
- **Quick returns** - Fast maturation and production
- **Space efficient** - Many birds in small area
- **Consistent income** - Daily egg production

### Challenges
- **Disease vulnerability** - Avian flu can devastate flocks
- **Low individual value** - Many birds needed for profit
- **Predation** - Vulnerable to predators
- **Labor intensive** - Egg collection and care

### Profit Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Egg focus | Maximize hen count for egg production |
| Breeding | Sell chicks and breeding stock |
| Meat birds | Raise roosters for meat market |
| Mixed | Combination approach |

## Herdsman Settings

The AI Herdsman charges the lowest rate for chickens ($2/month per bird) reflecting their minimal individual care needs.

!!! tip "Chicken Automation"
    Chickens benefit greatly from Herdsman automation due to large flock sizes making individual management impractical.

## Visual Features

- Small ear tags (proportional to size)
- Gender-distinct models (hens vs roosters)
- Age progression (chick to adult)
