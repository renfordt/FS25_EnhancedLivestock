# Genetics System

Enhanced Livestock introduces a comprehensive genetics system where each animal has five genetic traits that affect their performance and value.

## Genetic Traits

### Health
Affects the animal's resistance to diseases and overall constitution.

| Value Range | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Low (25-75%) | More susceptible to diseases |
| Average (75-125%) | Normal disease resistance |
| High (125-175%) | Strong disease resistance |

### Fertility
Determines the animal's reproductive success rate.

| Value Range | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Low | Reduced conception rate |
| Average | Normal breeding success |
| High | Improved conception rate |

### Metabolism
Controls food consumption and weight management.

| Value Range | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Low | Slower weight gain, less food needed |
| Average | Normal growth and consumption |
| High | Faster weight gain, more food needed |

### Productivity
Affects production output (milk, wool, eggs).

| Value Range | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Low | Reduced output |
| Average | Normal production levels |
| High | Increased output |

### Quality
Determines meat quality and affects sale value exponentially.

| Value Range | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Low | Lower meat quality, reduced sale price |
| Average | Normal quality and pricing |
| High | Premium meat quality, higher sale price |

!!! info "Quality Impact"
    Quality has an exponential effect on sale value, making high-quality genetics particularly valuable for meat animals.

## Genetic Values

All genetic traits use a percentage scale:

| Range | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 25-50% | Very Poor |
| 50-75% | Poor |
| 75-100% | Below Average |
| 100% | Average |
| 100-125% | Above Average |
| 125-150% | Good |
| 150-175% | Excellent |

## Inheritance

When animals breed, offspring inherit genetics from both parents through a weighted probability distribution:

1. Each parent contributes their genetic values
2. The system calculates a probability-weighted average
3. Small random variations are applied
4. The result becomes the offspring's genetics

### Breeding Strategy

To improve your herd's genetics:

- **Select high-quality breeding stock** - Choose animals with the traits you want to improve
- **Cull low performers** - Remove animals with poor genetics from your breeding program
- **Track lineage** - Use the family tree viewer to monitor genetic progress
- **Balanced approach** - Don't focus on just one trait; consider overall performance

## Economic Impact

Genetics directly affect your farm's profitability:

| Trait | Economic Effect |
|-------|-----------------|
| Health | Reduced veterinary costs |
| Fertility | More offspring per breeding cycle |
| Metabolism | Feed cost optimization |
| Productivity | Higher production output value |
| Quality | Premium sale prices |

## Viewing Genetics

You can view an animal's genetics through:

- The animal details screen
- The family tree viewer
- The animal dealer (when purchasing)
- The AI Herdsman interface (for filtering)
