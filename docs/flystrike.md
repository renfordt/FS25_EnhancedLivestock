# Flystrike (Myiasis)

Flystrike occurs when blowflies lay eggs in damp wool around the tail and breech area. Hatching maggots eat living flesh and release toxins that can kill rapidly if undetected. This is a **summer-only disease** that does **NOT naturally recover** - treatment is mandatory for survival.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Affected Animals | Sheep only |
| Transmission Rate | None (not contagious) |
| Immunity Period | 3 months (short) |
| Recovery Time | None (does NOT naturally recover) |
| Sale Value Impact | 60% reduction (0.4 multiplier) |
| Seasonal Pattern | **Summer ONLY**: 2.0x; Winter 0.0x (cannot occur) |

!!! danger "Summer-Only Disease - No Natural Recovery"
    Flystrike ONLY occurs in summer months and NEVER naturally recovers. Untreated sheep will die (30% fatality within 1 month). Treatment is absolutely mandatory.

## Infection Risk

### Base Probability

Flystrike can affect sheep of all ages during warm months:

| Age (months) | Base Probability |
|--------------|------------------|
| 0+ | 0.1% per month |

### Modifying Factors

**Health Genetics Modifier**
- Health 1.75 (best): 0.025% actual chance (75% reduction)
- Health 1.0 (average): 0.1% actual chance
- Health 0.25 (worst): 0.175% actual chance (75% increase)

**Seasonal Modifier (CRITICAL)**
- **Spring** (Mar-May): 1.0x probability (baseline)
- **Summer** (Jun-Aug): **2.0x probability** (peak fly season)
- **Autumn** (Sep-Nov): 1.0x probability (baseline)
- **Winter** (Dec-Feb): **0.0x probability (CANNOT OCCUR)**

**Overcrowding Modifier**
- >100% capacity: 2.0x probability
- 80-100% capacity: 1.3x probability
- <50% capacity: 0.8x probability

**Example:** A sheep with average health (1.0) in summer at >100% capacity:
- Base: 0.1%
- × Health: 1.0
- × Season: 2.0
- × Overcrowding: 2.0
- **= 0.4% monthly chance in summer**

### No Transmission

Flystrike is not contagious - it's caused by fly infestation:
- Does not spread sheep-to-sheep
- Each sheep's risk is independent
- Multiple cases indicate environmental fly problems

## Symptoms and Effects

### Production Impact

| Output Type | Modifier | Effect |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Wool (Pallets) | 30% | 70% reduction (devastating) |

!!! warning "Severe Wool Damage"
    The 70% wool reduction reflects both wool damage from maggots eating tissue and stress/toxemia preventing wool growth.

### Fatality

Flystrike has rapidly escalating mortality if untreated:

| Time After Onset | Fatality Rate | Cumulative Deaths |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Month 0 | 10% | 10% |
| Month 1 | 30% | ~37% total |

!!! danger "Rapid Deterioration"
    Flystrike progresses quickly. Maggots release toxins causing shock and death. The 30% month-1 fatality reflects untreated cases dying from toxemia.

## Disease Progression

### Active Disease States

1. **Active (Untreated)**
   - Maggots eating living tissue
   - Toxic shock from maggot secretions
   - Severe distress and wool damage
   - 70% wool production loss
   - Cannot spread to other sheep
   - 10% immediate fatality, 30% by month 1
   - 60% reduction in sale value
   - **NEVER naturally recovers**

2. **Being Treated**
   - $150 cost for 1 month
   - Remove maggots, clean wounds, treat infection
   - Production penalties continue during treatment
   - After 1 month, becomes immune
   - No transmission risk

3. **Immune (Recovered)**
   - Normal production resumes
   - Cannot develop flystrike for 3 months
   - No production penalties
   - No sale value penalty
   - **But can be reinfected in next summer**

### No Natural Recovery

Flystrike is unique - it NEVER naturally recovers:
- Sheep remain infested indefinitely without treatment
- Progressive tissue damage continues
- Increasing fatality risk over time
- **Treatment is the ONLY cure**

!!! danger "Treatment is Mandatory"
    Unlike most diseases, there is NO natural recovery option. Untreated sheep suffer progressive maggot damage and eventual death. Every case requires treatment - there is no alternative.

## Treatment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Treatment Available | Yes |
| Cost | $150 |
| Duration | 1 month |
| Total Cost | $150 |
| Immunity Granted | 3 months (short) |

### Treatment Process

1. Select the affected sheep in the animal dialog
2. Click the "Treat" button in the disease section
3. Pay the $150 treatment cost (MEDICINE finance category)
4. Treatment: remove maggots, clean wounds, antibiotics for secondary infection
5. Wait 1 month for treatment to complete
6. Sheep recovers and gains 3 months of immunity
7. Wool production returns to normal

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Approach | Cost | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| Immediate treatment | $150 | Survival, recovery in 1 month |
| No treatment | $0 | **Death (37% within 1 month), permanent infestation** |

!!! tip "Treatment is NOT Optional"
    There is no decision here - flystrike does NOT naturally recover. Treatment is mandatory or the sheep dies.

## Prevention

### Best Practices

**Crutching and Shearing (Critical)**
- **Crutch before summer** - Remove wool around tail/breech before fly season
- **Full shearing timing** - Shear in late spring before peak summer heat
- **Keep wool short** - Flies target long, damp wool
- **Clean crutching** - Remove dags (manure-stained wool) completely

**Preventive Sprays**
- **Cyromazine or dicyclanil** - Growth regulators prevent maggot development
- **Apply before fly season** - Late spring application
- **Reapply as needed** - Follow product instructions for duration
- **Focus on high-risk areas** - Tail, breech, back end

**Diarrhea Management**
- **Treat scours** - Diarrhea creates ideal fly breeding conditions
- **Deworm regularly** - Internal parasites cause loose manure
- **Manage diet** - Avoid sudden feed changes causing diarrhea
- **Clean dags immediately** - Don't let manure accumulate in wool

**Daily Monitoring**
- **Check daily in summer** - Flystrike develops in hours, not days
- **Look for signs** - Nibbling at tail, stained wool, fly activity, odor
- **Immediate action** - Hours matter - treat at first signs
- **Focus on high-risk sheep** - Those with diarrhea, long wool, or dags

**Environmental Management**
- **Avoid overcrowding** - Keep below 80% capacity
- **Good drainage** - Reduce wet conditions flies love
- **Manure management** - Remove manure to reduce fly breeding sites
- **Shade in summer** - Reduces fly activity

**Genetic Selection**
- **Breed for health** - High health genetics (1.5-1.75) reduce risk by up to 75%
- **Plain breech types** - Some sheep have less wool around tail (lower risk)
- **Track disease history** - Identify individuals prone to flystrike

### Risk Factors

| Factor | Risk Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Poor health genetics (0.25) | +75% | Selective breeding |
| Overcrowding (>100%) | +100% (doubles) | Expand facilities or reduce flock |
| **Summer season** | **+100% (doubles)** | **Maximum prevention in Jun-Aug** |
| Long wool | Very high | Crutch/shear before summer |
| Diarrhea/dags | Very high | Treat causes immediately |
| No preventive spray | Very high | Apply cyromazine before summer |
| Infrequent checking | Very high | **Daily checks in summer** |

## Economic Impact

### Direct Costs

| Cost Component | Amount | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Treatment (mandatory) | $150 | Required - no natural recovery |
| Lost wool production | 70% for duration | Severe impact |
| Sale value reduction | 60% | While sick |
| Death loss | 37% if untreated | Very high mortality |
| Prevention costs | $5-10/sheep/year | Crutching, sprays |

### Calculation Examples

**Single sheep with flystrike (treated immediately):**
- Treatment: $150
- Wool loss: 1 month at 70% = ~$20-35 lost
- Death risk: ~10%
- **Total cost: $150 + $25 = ~$175**

**Single sheep with flystrike (untreated):**
- Treatment: $0
- Death risk: **37%**
- If dies: ~$150 sheep value lost
- If survives (unlikely): Permanent infestation, progressive deterioration
- **Expected cost: 0.37 × $150 = ~$55 in deaths, but inhumane**

**Flock of 100 sheep, summer, no prevention:**
- Expected cases: 2-4 sheep (0.2% × 2.0 summer × overcrowding factors)
- Treatment: 3 × $150 = $450
- **vs. prevention: 100 × $8 spray = $800, but prevents nearly all cases**

**Prevention cost-benefit:**
- Annual prevention: $800 (crutching $300 + spray $500)
- Expected cases without prevention: 5 sheep
- Treatment costs: 5 × $150 = $750
- Deaths avoided: 5 × 10% × $150 = $75
- **Prevention cost: $800 vs. treatment+deaths: $825 = roughly break-even**
- **But prevention provides welfare and avoids emergencies**

### Indirect Costs

- **Severe welfare concerns** - Maggots eating living flesh is inhumane
- **Management stress** - Daily checking in summer labor-intensive
- **Reputation damage** - Flystrike reflects poor management
- **Emergency response** - Treating acute cases requires immediate action
- **Psychological toll** - Witnessing maggot infestations is distressing

## Management Strategy

!!! tip "Flystrike Prevention and Control Protocol"
    **1. Pre-Summer Preparation (Critical)**
    - Crutch all sheep in late spring (remove tail/breech wool)
    - OR full shear before summer
    - Apply preventive spray (cyromazine/dicyclanil)
    - Treat any diarrhea or parasites before fly season
    - Clean all dags from wool

    **2. Summer-Only Disease**
    - Flystrike CANNOT occur in winter (0.0x risk)
    - Risk doubles in summer (2.0x)
    - All prevention must be done before/during Jun-Aug
    - Relax monitoring in winter - impossible to get flystrike

    **3. Daily Monitoring in Summer**
    - Check every sheep daily during Jun-Aug
    - Look for: nibbling at tail, fly activity, wet/stained wool, odor
    - Early detection critical - hours matter
    - Focus on sheep with diarrhea or dags

    **4. Immediate Treatment (Mandatory)**
    - Flystrike NEVER naturally recovers
    - Treat at first signs - don't delay
    - $150 cost is non-negotiable for survival
    - Remove maggots, clean wounds, antibiotics
    - Untreated = death sentence (37% mortality)

    **5. Diarrhea = Emergency**
    - Diarrhea in summer = extreme flystrike risk
    - Treat cause immediately (worms, diet, disease)
    - Clean dags from affected sheep daily
    - Consider isolation until resolved

    **6. Short Immunity Management**
    - Only 3 months immunity
    - Can be reinfected same summer
    - Continue prevention even for recovered sheep
    - Spray wears off - may need reapplication

    **7. Prevention vs. Treatment**
    - Prevention: $8/sheep (spray + crutching)
    - Treatment: $150/case
    - Prevention prevents suffering - worth it for welfare alone
    - Even if costs similar, prevention avoids emergencies

    **8. High-Risk Identification**
    - Sheep with diarrhea (any cause)
    - Long wool despite crutching
    - Ewes with lambs (more stressed, less grooming)
    - Sheep with dags that reaccumulate quickly
    - Monitor these individuals extra carefully

    **9. Environmental Control**
    - Avoid overcrowding in summer
    - Good drainage reduces wet wool
    - Shade reduces heat stress and fly activity
    - Manure removal reduces fly breeding

    **10. Genetic Selection**
    - Breed for plain breech (less wool at tail)
    - Select for good dung consistency (less dags)
    - High health genetics reduce risk 75%
    - Cull sheep that repeatedly get flystrike
